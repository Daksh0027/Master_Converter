# Technical Architecture  
- **System components**: React frontend, Node.js backend with FFmpeg, temporary file storage
- **Data models**: UploadedFile { filename, size, type, uploadTimestamp }, ConversionJob { jobId, status, inputFilePath, outputFilePath, createdAt, completedAt }
- **APIs and integrations**: POST /api/convert (accepts MP4, returns MP3), optional cloud storage
- **Infrastructure requirements**: Node.js server, FFmpeg, disk space for temp files, HTTPS

# Development Roadmap  
- **MVP requirements**: Frontend upload/conversion/download, backend conversion, error handling
- **Future enhancements**: Support more formats, user accounts, batch conversion, email notifications, progress bar, cloud storage

# Logical Dependency Chain
- Build backend API for upload/conversion (foundation)
- Build frontend for upload/trigger/download
- Add status feedback and error handling
- (Optional) Add enhancements (accounts, batch, cloud)

# Risks and Mitigations  
- Technical: Large files, timeouts (mitigate with limits, streaming)
- MVP scope: Feature creep (mitigate by clear MVP definition)
- Resources: Server/storage load (mitigate with cleanup, monitoring)

# Appendix  
- Research: FFmpeg for conversion
- Specs: React frontend, Node.js/Express backend, 100MB file limit (configurable)
